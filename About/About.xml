        <![CDATA[[h1]Purpose[/h1]
Extracts translation files for the selected mod.
This tool works differently from the game’s original system, so the order of strings may not always match the default extraction method. However, all required strings should still be included. [u]If you notice any missing entries, please let me know.[/u]

[h2]Instructions[/h2]
[list]
    [*]Enable this mod together with the mod whose strings you want to extract.
    [*]For best results, make sure that all possible dependencies of the target mod are also present. By [b]possible[/b] dependencies I mean mods that the target mod can interact with, but which are not strictly required.
[/list]

[h3]Example[/h3]
Let’s take [b]Alpha Animals[/b]. Its loadFolders.xml contains the line:
[code]<li IfModActive="VanillaExpanded.VPsycastsE">1.5/Mods/VanillaPsycastsExpanded</li>[/code]
This means that if [b]Vanilla Psycasts Expanded[/b] is installed, [b]Alpha Animals[/b] will unlock extra features — and potentially new strings.
Of course, these extra mods are not mandatory, but if you want a 100% complete translation, it’s better to have such possible dependencies enabled.
